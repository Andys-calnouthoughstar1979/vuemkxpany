Brooooooo, just finished You're Cordially Invited and I'm all over the place! I was like, okay let's download the movie, and boom, what a ride! The drama my dude, I swear I wasn’t ready for that little twist at the end. Did you see that coming? She was all “SURPRISE!” and honestly, I spit my drink out. Haha, worth it tho.

Anyway, so there’s this part where they just keep going back and forth and I'm just like, c’mon make up your mind already. Felt kind of tired just watching them, but then again, aren't we all a little tired? 😂 It's like they knew everyone watching would be like, Okay, get to the good part. sips coffee.

> Oh but get this, they have this epic showdown and for a second, I thought, Wait… aren't they gonna... but then BAM! Seriously, they dropped the ball and caught it in the same scene. Who writes this stuff?? It's like, how do you make chaotic energy feel so genius?

Yeah, so about downloading the movie... worth every byte, if you ask me. Plus, that soundtrack? Whew, it just hits different when you watch the movie late at night, when the world's asleep, you know what I mean? All the sneaky plot points and then this music just gets you right in the feels.

Did I tell you about the dialogue? It’s like everyone there was born conversationalists, haha. The back and forth was sharp, but honestly, some lines were so cheesy, I had to pause and cringe. Like, do people even talk like that IRL? Guys, get a grip on reality please. 😆

for i in range(10): print(Lost in thoughts lol)

Alright, guess I've rambled enough for one night. Gonna crash now before my brain fries any more. Hit me up when you watch it, we gotta dissect it together. Laterz!
